## 👾 Stack

These are the stacks that is used for this project

- Nuxt 3
- Strapi
- Tailwind
- Formkit
- Pinia

### Font Selection

Based on the glimpse of the UI design, the font families that close enough to the word match are

- Alata
- Outfit
- League Spartan

Alata's style for the number "1" has no bent tip. Outfit's number "1" style in the other hand shows too right-agled tip. After that reason --and other considerations, League Spartan was chosen.
